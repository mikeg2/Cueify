Style Notes General:

Methods should be defined as "public void functionName() {" with the first "{"
on the same line as the method name and the second "}" on its own line. 

Style Notes Specific:
1) Java Properties

For widely used classes, should define a setProperty(), getProperty() for setting
the values, along with a property() function for the property itself.

For classes not used widely, or only to assist another class, it is acceptable
only to define property()
